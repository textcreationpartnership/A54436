            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as many Members fitly composed do make one compleat Body, and each Member of that living body in true senseâ–ª of the griefs and fellow-feeling of the infirmities and sufferings of each other, cannot but love its own flesh, to strengthen it with the true nourishment suitable to its own nature, and earnestly labour to keep every member and part thereof sound and whole, free from all bruises, hurts or wounds, and having not another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the pure nature of love unto its flesh of the same flesh, each member is given therefore to know, that whatsoever mind or spirit it is, which willingly bruiseth or hurteth the least or lowest member of the living body, is not of it, but degenerated and gone from the pure natural love thereof, into that which corrupteth in its own way, and cannot return to the first love again, to be united to the body without Repentance, and therefore it was gloriously given forth in the Law of God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou shalt not make cuttings in thy own flesh,</hi> because from all eternity it was the mind of the Wise Creator that his sound and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100893:2"/> glorious workmanship, should be preserved in a sound living and unbroken state of glory, to the praise of his Power that created it, to which purpose that the number of the children of the birth of God, and babes of the bosom of his pleasure, may so live in perfect love, keeping the unity of the spirit, as that their whole life may be as a continual full basket of the bread of blessing, and cup of overflowing consolation to each other, my spirit of meeknesse entreateth for a free hearing among all in the pure exercise of the living Word of exhortation unto all.</p>
            <p>All dear Souls which do find in your selves an often feeling of temptation, of whatsoever kind or nature it be, Learn ye the knowledge of your own souls as they were created, in the day that they were made, to see the weaknesse and changable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them out of the Power that created them, and in this sense of understanding learn ye, and grow ye into the humble meek and lowly life of the <hi>LAMB which taketh away the sin of the World,</hi> and these perfect steps will lead your souls and minds unto the door of the pure and perfect fear of the Lord God, and the fear will shut you up into the holy house of the <hi>heavenly dread and trembling,</hi> where transgression cannot enter upon you, and keeping your constant watch to walk in this path, you will find this spirit of the perfect dread abundantly to fill your souls with the perfect fear, and as this spirit waxeth mighty and increaseth in you, so the spirit of temptation, will decrease, wax weak and feeble and depart from you, which your diligence in watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will throughly experience to your joyful growth in the saving power, which delivereth from all that which is able to give just occasion of grief unto any other member of the body, by all which a happy harvest of gladness comes to be gathered in your own souls, and you stand a sweet savour of joyous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing unto all that you are joyned unto in the spirit of power and life.</p>
            <p>And all pretious Plants of Gods <hi>glorious garden</hi> which are growing in prosperous places, every one in your proper degrees keep in the ground which is without offence, least in you should unhappily spring up <hi>a weed of the bitterness of discord,</hi> and that in the end bring forth a seeding seed of enmity, and so the whole ground become an over-spread plantation of cursedness, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100893:2"/> you utterly lose the benefit of the blessed fruits of salvation; to the purpose therefore of avoiding the course, and retaining and keeping the blessing of everlasting life, Learn ye <hi>the knowledge of the garden,</hi> and all things that grows and are therein, that never any true fruit which ripeneth therein, and is gathered <hi>in the day of the perfection</hi> thereof may in the least be a grief unto you, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing least your grief at such a thing being the fruits of the labour of him that planted you, should become both a grief unto his soul who is Lord of the garden, and a sore sorrow unto your other fellow plants which bare the ripe fruits, and lastly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the <hi>gardener</hi> and Lord of the work to cut off (at least wise) your branches, if not to pluck you up by the roots, as the weeds of murmuration against him and his profitable plants. For O my dear and tender ones, known be it unto you that in the <hi>garden of Gods glory</hi> there are diversities of Herbs, Roses and pleasant flowers, yet all are of one Maker, Creator and Planter, yea also and all of one nature of sweetness and benefit of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their respective services and uses, and therefore if the <hi>white Rose</hi> doth not comprehend the fragrancie or sweet smel of the <hi>damask Rose,</hi> and if the <hi>Lilly</hi> hath an ornament of vertue which the <hi>Violet</hi> hath not, yet they ought all to be content with the vertue and excellency in which they are created, and so likewise all the other sweet herbs and flowers; For cast ye up every one your eye unto the Heavens, and behold the vineyard of the upper glory, which you may happily perceive and see among the <hi>Stars,</hi> which do greatly differ in glory, not in nature, because every one is of a surpassing brightness, but in degree and proportion, for that one is seen to be of brightness <hi>seven times</hi> more and greater then an other, and yet they keep their order according to the appointment of their Creator, and lo it is as a <hi>body of glory</hi> which jarreth not, for the Stars that are <hi>fixed</hi> are not grieved at the motion and course of the <hi>moving Stars,</hi> neither are the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in any thing grieved at the fixed, neither are the <hi>lesser in glory</hi> troubled at the brightness of the <hi>greater in glory,</hi> nor the greater at the lesser, for they all stand in the wisdome in which they were created, knowing that they are all created, and in that knowledge doth clearly perceive that there is as much cause for the greater in glory to grieve at the lesser, which cannot comprehend his glory, as there is for the lesser to grieve, being

            <p>Likewise my dearly beloved ones, know ye in an other thing the true order of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> that when the <hi>sore hail doth fall,</hi> it doth not fall against any part of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> but heavily down upon the <hi>earthly places,</hi> and when it <hi>thunders,</hi> it doth not thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der against the <hi>Heavens</hi> or any thing therein, for such things would work against the nature of the wisdome and glory in Heaven, and the Kingdome would become <hi>divided in its self,</hi> therefore when it thunders, it is against <hi>Hell</hi> and all that is in the infernal places, for the breach of the power and Dominion of that Kingdome and enlargement of the glory of the heavenly, in the glorious light whereof ye may all learn how to walk in all your passages and footsteps, that ye may evermore be a continual gladness and not a grief to one another; But yet if all cannot so openly see the mind of my spirit (in what I have thus far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed) as it is my souls sincere desire to the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that they may, I am very free in the same <hi>motion of life</hi> to tell you the Doctrine of <hi>John</hi> my predecessor and glorious
